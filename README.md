# Vampirism
A plugin for RuneLite that will allow the player to see client-side vampire morph's of players who
installed the plugin and got biten or ate the forbidden fruit. Currently this is just a rough draft
of what I would like to add to the plugin since I am currently burnt out on runescape.

# Plans
* A Website Tracker for Last Vampire Attacks / Pinged Locations
* Vampiric Books that show how to cure / put off permanent Vampiric Transition
* The ability to drink blood from entities such as "Cows, Goblins, NPC's and Players"
